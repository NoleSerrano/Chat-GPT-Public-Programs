## davinciresolve.cmd
It goes through Davinci Resolve's cache, and for each of the projects, it prints out the name of the project as well as the project's folder. Useful for seeing which projects you want to keep and delete. To use, download the cmd file (you can use [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home) to just download a singular file) and then change directory to where the file is located and then just type `davinciresolve.cmd` to run it which will then show you the project's folder and also the name of the project.
