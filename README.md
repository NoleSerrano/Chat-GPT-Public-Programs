## davinciresolve.cmd
It goes through Davinci Resolve's cache, and for each of the projects, it prints out the name of the project as well as the project's folder. Useful for seeing which projects you want to keep and delete. To use, download the cmd file (you can use [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home) to just download a singular file) and then change directory to where the file is located and then just type `davinciresolve.cmd` to run it which will then show you the project's folder and also the name of the project.

## steamaccounts.bat
If you play on a lot of steam accounts, you might have a lot of user data from Steam. This is located here on Windows: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata`. This batch file will get the steam account persona name and display it next to the full folder path. This is useful for finding accounts that you don't need anymore more quickly and thus freeing up a lot of space on your computer. To run, download the file, open up a command prompt, change directory to where the file is stored, and then just type `steamaccounts.bat` to run it and it will show you the appropriate output.
